                        <h2>About me </h2>
                        <p> Iâ€™ve always been drawn to the stories that shape our culture, whether through music, film, or fashion. Over the years, Iâ€™ve built a career breaking down the sounds and visuals that move us, always looking beyond the surface to uncover what really matters.<br><br>
                    As the CEO of CTDA Media, I lead a team committed to Connecting the Dots Among Blacks, telling our stories with depth, honesty, and insight. Through the CTDA Media Podcast, I get to have real, unfiltered conversations about the hits, the misses, and the moments that define our industry.<br><br>
                    Music has taken me places I never imagined. From the front lines of pop culture to the Grammy Awards, Iâ€™ve had the privilege of witnessing the magic of musicâ€™s biggest night. But my work goes beyond criticism. I also help artists refine their teams, shape their vision, and cut through the noise to build a brand that lasts.<br><br>
                    Fashion and art have always been part of my world. Most people donâ€™t know it runs in my family, but that love led me to create CTDA Fashion, a brand thatâ€™s set to return with fresh designs that reflect both culture and creativity.<br><br>
                    At the heart of everything I do, I want to spark conversations, challenge perspectives, and celebrate the art that brings us together. So whether youâ€™re here to check out my latest review, dive into a debate, or collaborate on something meaningful, letâ€™s connect.
